# Dopamine Framework

Dopamine Framework is a framework for discord.py which allows you to initialize a production-ready Discord bot in just 4 lines of code. It is designed to streamline the development of scalable Discord applications by automating the process of registering commands, diagnosing the bot, and various other utilities such as a paginator helper and "Private View" helpers which let only the user who initiated the interaction to interact with the components like buttons.

## Installing

**Use Python 3.12 or higher:**

```Linux/MacOS
# Linux/MacOS
python3 -m pip install -U dopamine-framework
```
```Windows
# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U dopamine-framework
```
## Features

### 1. Smart Command Syncs

The framework includes a Command Registry that compares local command states with remote Discord API states. This ensures that global and guild-specific slash commands are only synced when changes are detected, preventing unnecessary API overhead and rate-limit triggers.

### 2. Diagnostics

The built-in `Diagnostics` "cog" (module) provides real-time monitoring of the bot's health, including:

* **Latency:** High precision API, Heartbeat, and Round-trip latency monitoring.
* **Resource Utilization:** CPU and RAM usage tracking via `psutil`.
* **Graphs:** Generate graphs for the bot's latency for visual performance auditing.
* **Host Device Metrics:** Integration with system sensors to report host location and battery status, if available.

### 3. In-Discord Owner Dashboard

No need for terminal access/SSH. This simple to use and feature-rich dashboard for bot owners allows you to unload/reload cogs on the fly, restart the bot, or check logs, accessed using `/od`. This allows bot owner(s) to manage, diagnose the bot right within Discord itself. This dashboard allows the bot to run idefinitely without restarts:

* **Cog Management:** Dynamic loading, unloading, and reloading of cogs.
* **Power State:** Remote shutdown and process-level restarts.
* **Logs:** Real-time retrieval of local log files via the Discord UI.
* **Manual Command Syncs:** Sync commands manually globally or within only the current guild.

### 4. Built-in Logging Backend

* A robust Logging Manager utilizing `aiosqlite` that can be plugged into any feature of your bot to implement a logging system, such as for mod logs, action logs, etc.

<sup>*Scalability refers to ability to run without problems when the bot is in tens of thousands of servers or more. While it's a common myth that "Python is bloated", that's not true in the context of Discord bots. The real bottleneck in popular Discord bots always comes down to network, not code execution time or memory usage.</sup>

## Implementation Example

To initialize a bot using the Dopamine Framework, follow the following example:

```python
import discord
from dopamine_framework import Bot

bot = Bot(command_prefix="?", cogs_path="modules", logging_path="logging.db", default_diagnostics=True, intents=discord.Intents.default()) # If no cogs folder is defined, it will default to "cogs". If no logging path, logging will be disabled.

bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE")
```

---

## Requirements

* `discord.py`
* `aiosqlite`
* `psutil`
* `Pillow`
* `geocoder`

---

## Logging Manager Documentation

The LoggingManager is an asynchronous backend designed to facilitate per-guild Discord channel logging for things such as mod logs, action logs, and more.

* **`self.logger.get(guild.id)`:** Get the logging channel, where guild.id the guild whose logging channel's ID you want to get.
* **`self.logger.set(guild.id, channel_id)`:** Set the logging channel, where guild.id the guild and channel_id is the ID of the channel to be set for logging.
* **`self.logger.delete(guild.id)`:** Delete the logging channel, where guild.id the guild whose logging channel you want to delete.

### Example:

```python
import discord
from dopamine_framework import Bot

bot = Bot(command_prefix="?", cogs_path="modules", logging_path="logging.db", default_diagnostics=True, intents=discord.Intents.default()) # Define logging path to enable logging. If no logging path, logging will be disabled.

bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE")
```
